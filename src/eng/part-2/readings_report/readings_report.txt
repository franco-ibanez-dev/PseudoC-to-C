Assignment:
From an RS232 device, a program reads characters sent by a sensor. Readings are 
done in 5-character buffers, which must arrive in a fixed format: the first 
character must be X and the last one must be 0. Read sequences that comply with 
the format are considered correct. The special sequence '&&&&&' marks the end of
the transmissions (let's call it FDE), and any sequence that is different from
FDE and not correct is considered invalid. At the end of the process, a report 
is printed indicating the percentages of correct and invalid readings received.

What processing, operations, or tasks should my program perform? What strategy
should it follow?

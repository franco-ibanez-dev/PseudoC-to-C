Assigment:
Create a program that simulates a simple calculator. The program should read two
numbers and a character. If the character is a plus sign (+), it should print 
the sum; if it is a minus sign (-), it should print the difference; if it is an 
asterisk (*), it should display the product; if it is a slash (/), it should 
print the quotient (if it's not possible to calculate, the program should issue
a warning). To implemment this functionality, use the CASE control structure.
